- Battle Description:
  Peter - "Mother Puft Bucket! You've got an enemy! Well there's somethin' you don't see every day."

Raymond - "I tried to think of the most harmless thing I could think of. Something harmless. Something that could never hurt us. Something I loved from my childhood."

Everyone is terrified beyond the point of rational thought. The choice is on you!

What do you do???????????

- fight- Lock and load!!! Everyone shoot together and hold until Puft is dead!!!!

- flight - Run away and make a plan!!!!
  --- Sorry, Puft is huge and you were unable to escape him. Sadly, he was quite cruel and cutely giggled as he stepped on you. All HP lost.

- negotiate: Sorry, Puft is out to take over the world and you were wrong to think he was reasonable. You were crushed under the consuming size of Puft. All HP depleted and you died. Sorry not sorry. I'd say take this as a life lesson, but you're no longer alive. You tried to reason with a monster.
